# Bachelor Thesis Codes
PYTHIA and ROOT codes utilised to create the results and figures of my bachelor thesis. The treeMacro files create the plots (treeMacro: results, treeMacro2: comparison with ALICE data and centrality). For simulation: pythiaEvent.hh simulates 1 collision, RunCreatePythiaEvents.cc uses pythiaEvent.hh to do many collisions.
